GANT 

INTODUCTION

Google Apps Network Tests (GANT) is a Python based tool converted into a Windows
executable that will perform DNS resolution, HTTP connection, and Web based 
logon tests to Google Apps services. 

GANT is a command line tool that allows Google Apps Partners and solution
providers to gather DNS resolution and HTTP connection test results into a text
file or a Google Spreadsheet. Ideally this tool should be run before the 
Deployment Planning Workshop as part of the environment discovery process. The 
results should be attached to the Network Environment section in the Google Apps
Deployment Checklist. The GANT test result set includes DNS response times, Time
To Live (TTL) values, and HTTP response codes to help bring attention to possible 
issues that a customer device may have such as slow DNS lookups or inability to
connect reliably to Google Apps services.
